# tex-tagging
A system for tagging tex files

## TODO

- We need a much more complete dataset. 
  - Tagging of much more than one chapter must be completed.
  - More thorough tagging ... DW, send me the "dictionary" you're using
- Once the tagging is in better shape, successively run the "higher" submodule code until the `pims-filter` is run
- The Classifier code should be in a separate repo from this and included as a submodule of this repo.
  - Once this is working, we could auto-tag much more data!
- This repo needs to be renamed. I think something like `tex-tagger` ... think about what this does in general and what someone unrelated to the project would need to know to understand it
- This repo needs a useful `README`
